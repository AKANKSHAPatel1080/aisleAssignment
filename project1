To implement the described functionality in a scalable way, I could follow these steps:

1. **User Data Management:**   Store user data such as their location, last refresh time, 
and current like count in a database. This could be a NoSQL database like MongoDB or a 
relational database like PostgreSQL.
2. **Timezone Conversion:**   When a user registers, ask for their timezone. Use this 
timezone information to convert their local time to a standard time, like UTC. This 
helps ensure that the likes are refreshed at the same time for users across different 
timezones.
3. **Daily Like Refresh:**   Set up a daily job scheduler that runs at a specific time 
(e.g., 12:00 pm UTC). This scheduler should iterate through all users and update their 
like counts and refresh times. If the current time in the user's timezone is 12:00 pm, 
reset their like count to 10. If not, leave their like count unchanged until their local 
time reaches 12:00 pm.
4. **Optimizing Database Queries:**   Use indexing and caching mechanisms to optimize database 
queries when retrieving and updating user data. This helps improve the efficiency of 
operations, especially as the user base grows.
5. **Load Balancing and Scaling:**   Deploy the backend on a cloud infrastructure like AWS,
Azure, or Google Cloud. Utilize load balancers to distribute incoming requests evenly across 
multiple server instances. This ensures that the system can handle high traffic and distribute 
the workload effectively.
6. **Data Partitioning:**   As the user base grows, consider partitioning the user data across
multiple databases or shards. This prevents any single database from becoming a bottleneck and 
allows for better horizontal scaling.
7. **Monitoring and Scaling Up:**   Implement monitoring tools to keep track of system 
performance, such as response times and server resource utilization. When you notice that the 
system's capacity is approaching its limits, scale up by adding more server instances or 
resources.
8. **Error Handling and Redundancy:**   Implement error handling mechanisms to handle situations 
such as database failures, network issues, or job scheduler failures. Use redundancy strategies 
like backups and failover mechanisms to ensure data integrity and high availability.
9. **Security Considerations:**   Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms 
to ensure that users can only access their own data. Encrypt sensitive user information, such as 
passwords, and follow best practices for securing the backend infrastructure.

By combining these steps and utilizing modern cloud technologies and best practices, you can create 
a scalable backend system that efficiently manages daily likes for millions of users across different timezones.
